Due to university policy, I am unable to upload coursework code publicly to prevent plaigiarism. Therefore, this readme file contains summaries of each project completed to give an overview of my experience at university.

## Portfolio & online store website for a musician 
This assignment tasked us with creating a website for a musician of our choosing to showcase their work, provide information, and allow fans to purchase merchandise using an online store system. This was developed using HTML, CSS and PHP. The website also included a fully functional login system, as well as a review system for the items in the store.
