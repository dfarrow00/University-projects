Due to university policy, I am unable to upload coursework code publicly to prevent plaigiarism. Therefore, this readme file contains summaries of each project completed to give an overview of my experience at university.

## Portfolio & online store website for a musician 
This assignment tasked us with creating a website for a musician of our choosing to showcase their work, provide information, and allow fans to purchase merchandise using an online store system. This was developed using HTML, CSS and PHP. The website also included a fully functional login system, as well as a review system for the items in the store.

## Java Virtual Cafe
This assignment tasked us with creating a virtual cafe utilizing threads and sockets in Java. Each client application plays the role of a customer, who can place tea and coffee orders, and the server application plays the role of a barista, who processes the orders, prepares tea and coffee, and delivers orders back to customers. A text-based protocol was used for communication between the clients and the server. Synchronization was used to prevent race conditions between the threads in the application.

## Small Compiler
I created a source language and compiler in Java using the ANTLR4 library. Regular Expressions were used to define the grammar of the source language. The compiler works by first performing lexical analysis on the input code to produce tokens, which are then used in parsing to create a parse tree. This parse tree is then used to translate the source code into executable python code. The language/compiler supports variables, expressions, sequencing of statements, control flow structures and functions. The compiler also performs type checking and error handling.
